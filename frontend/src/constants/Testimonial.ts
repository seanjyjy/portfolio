      "I have worked with Sean on multiple projects during his internship at Shopee. Sean is a fast learner, able to adapt quickly to new environments, and eager to contribute ideas on improving things like code quality and DX (Developer Experience). He's done an excellent job executing those ideas! In addition, he was able to complete the tasks given to him very well and deliver the results promptly while upholding the quality of work. For all that, Sean provided a significant contribution to our team. I hope to work with you again, and all the best for your future endeavours!",

      "Sean is one of the best intern I have ever work with. His integrity, intelligence and the attitude really impressed me during the whole internship from the first to the last hour. He pick up new skill set really fast, step in to the unfamiliar code base instantly and taking ownership of it. Keep focusing on implementing new features and and finally able to assist a really big production release. During the process, he also communicated with many different backend engineers and production owner to ensure the understanding and expectation and be excellent in the final release and also have great follow up after that. I hope to work with you again Sean and also wish a great future for you.",

      "Sean displayed the skills and attitude to be a strong frontend engineer. While interning with our team, he took on the task of revamping our web app for a new generation look and improved functionalities. The team are impressed with the speed he delivers and the quality of work. Notwithstanding, he also shows an eagerness to learn and is able to articulate well the issues he faced and the approaches he took. We placed high standard on our code and Sean with little guidance exceeded those expectations. I am confident he will be an asset to any development team.",

      "I have worked with Sean Lum on multiple person and school projects, and he is without a doubt, one of the smartest, diligent and passionate individuals I know. The project that that left the deepest impression on me was SortAlgo, where he was the leader of my team. In order to help students understand and visualise common sorting algorithms, we came together as a team of 3 to build a sorting visualiser website, and he volunteered to take up the leaderâ€™s role. As the leader of the group, he came up with the UIUX design of the application, volunteered to take up the hardest parts of the code despite having no prior experience in react and facilitated the entire scrum process by always providing constructive feedbacks and improvements on things that needs to be done. Under his leadership, we managed to set up a CICD pipe line and complete the web application in 3 weeks. It was a pleasure working with Sean. I have learnt much from him, and look forward to working with him more in the future.",
