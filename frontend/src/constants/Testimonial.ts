      "Sean displayed the skills and attitude to be a strong frontend engineer. While interning with our team, he took on the task of revamping our web app for a new generation look and improved functionalities. The team are impressed with the speed he delivers and the quality of work. Notwithstanding, he also shows an eagerness to learn and is able to articulate well the issues he faced and the approaches he took. We placed high standard on our code and Sean with little guidance exceeded those expectations. I am confident he will be an asset to any development team.",

      "Sean is one of the best intern I have ever work with. His integrity, intelligence and the attitude really impressed me during the whole internship from the first to the last hour. He pick up new skill set really fast, step in to the unfamiliar code base instantly and taking ownership of it. Keep focusing on implementing new features and and finally able to assist a really big production release. During the process, he also communicated with many different backend engineers and production owner to ensure the understanding and expectation and be excellent in the final release and also have great follow up after that. I hope to work with you again Sean and also wish a great future for you.",
